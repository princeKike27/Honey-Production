# Honey-Production

For this project I analyzed data from honey bee production in the US. As you may have heard, honey bees are in a precarious state right now, news and articles are informing about the decline of the honey bees population and the impact it will cause on the entire planet. This is because, honey bees are the world's most important pollinator of food crops. It is estimated that one third of the food that we consume each day like avocados, soybeans, asparagus and kiwis rely on bees pollination. I will investigate the decline of honey bee production in the US  and how the trends of the past will enable us to predict the future for the honeybees in this country.

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

* Data cleaning and standardization.
* Analysis of Honey Bee Production in the US from 1998 to 2012.
* Visualization of average honey bee production, average stock and average price per pound in the US over the years.
* Creation of Linear Regression Model for average honey bees production.
* Prediction of honey bees production decline.
