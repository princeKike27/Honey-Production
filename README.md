# Honey-Production

For this project I analyzed data from honey production in the US. As you may have heard, honeybees are in a precarious state right now; news and articles are informing about the decline of the honeybee population for various reasons and the impact it will cause on the entire planet. I will investigate this decline and how the trends of the past predict the future for the honeybees.
